To test the code with pre-created melodies, you can do the following:
- Open melodies.txt, and copy into the clipboard one of the note sequences of your choosing.
- Execute SettingGUI.java found in \src\main\. Be sure you have latest version of Java installed (uses JavaFX).
- Click on "Melody creator", then paste the note sequence into the textarea.
- Click one of the following radio buttons: Classic/Tonal, Default, Modern/Atonal.
- Click on "Harmonize." The process could take a minute or so, depending on your system.
- Once finished, a new file called "test1.mid" should appear.

Feel free to listen to some or all of the test cases (.mid files).
